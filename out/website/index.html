      <p class="flex max-w-3xl justify-center items-center pt-4 m-auto text-gray-400 ">I'm Ertan a 20 year old programmer. I started Coding when i was 18 Years old and had a lot of fun with it,
        then i started studying comuter sience in Hamburg. After the first Semester i had a very bad and lost feeling and it didn't felt right to continue studiying. 
        I decided to go out of university and didn't had a plan for the future, my Heart was broken and i thought coding is not for me.
        But after a few months i was looking at my projects and was motivated again but to go to university again was not an Option, so i started an Apprenticeshop at
        Toolport GmbH and i am really happy with my decision. A Apprenticeship is way more practical then theoretical and i can learn a lot of things in a shorter time.
        If you are motivated to learn coding, then I recommend you just start and don't think much, you'll get better and better over time. You can do it, keep your head up
